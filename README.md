🎃 Hacktoberfest 2024 - Contribute to Our Project! 🎉

Welcome to our repository for Hacktoberfest 2024! We're excited to have you here and can't wait to see what amazing contributions you'll make. This repository is open for contributions throughout October, with special recognition for Hacktoberfest participants. Let's make something awesome together!
📌 What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is an annual event organized by DigitalOcean and its partners. The goal is to encourage people to contribute to open-source projects and give back to the community. Anyone who contributes to open-source projects in October can qualify to receive a limited-edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt or plant a tree in their name.

To participate:

    Sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website.
    Submit 4 pull requests (PRs) to any public repository on GitHub, including this one, during October.
    Be sure to follow Hacktoberfest's rules and guidelines to ensure your PRs count toward the challenge!

Contribution Rules📚:

    You are allowed to make pull requests that break the rules. We just merge it ;)
    Do NOT add any build steps, e.g., npm install (we want to keep this a simple static site)
    Do NOT remove other content.
    Styling/code can be pretty, ugly, or stupid, big or small, as long as it works

    Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts
